Provenances may be stored.  Whenever a provenance is created, it is tapped for storage in the configured Storage.  (should that be an implicit instead?)

A DerivationStrategy produces provenances from derivations.  It may or may not consult some storage.



Derivations should always be specified with def.  They may get created redundantly, but that doesn't matter; when they are resolved, they'll return the same cached result anyway.  Using only defs avoids any confusion about overrides and initialization order.

Ack-- everything to do with TypedPaths is unnecessary.  Leaving it in for now in case we need to reinstate.
